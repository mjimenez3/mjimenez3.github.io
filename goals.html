                    <h1>Goals</h1>
                    <p>Although I don't have a background in IT specifically, I have always enjoyed learning about computers and how they work.  I regret beginning 
                            this journey so late, but better late than never.  So I am, as VWC put it, drinking from a fire hose in all things IT and trying to find my niche.
                            I have interests in website and application development, cloud, and cybersecurity.  I have enjoyed learning to code and develop my website and know that this is only the beginning of my lifelong journey in coding 
                            and my new career as an IT professional.
