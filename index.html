                    <h1>About Me</h1>
                    <p>I was born and raised in Los Angeles, California.  I have been married for 14 years and have two rapidly growing kids.
                        I joined the US Navy in September 1999 in the Advanced Electronic Computer Field and chose the rate of Fire Controlman. 
                        Some of my duty stations include USS Thorn (DD-988), USS Cape St. George (CG-71), USS Enterprise (CVN 65), USS Winston S. Churchill (DDG-81).
                        I will be retiring after 20 years and 4 months in January 2020.

                    <H1>Favorite Things</H1>
                    <p>Most of my favorite things revolve around church and sports. I teach both a Men's Bible Study, and 5th grade Sunday School at my church.
                        My love for sports starts with the LA Dodgers since I was 7 years old.  My favorite football team is due to LA not having a team and my
                        uncle always sending me jerseys- Pittsburgh Steelers.
                        I love to play basketball, baseball, or any competitive sport.
